JBACAP v2.0: Jailbreak-Activate-Contracts-Automatically-Program (Roblox)

To activate contracts in Jailbreak after the time of the current set of contracts is up, you have to be in-game and then a 16h countdown timer starts from the moment you enter in-game.
I know that my friends and I cannot perfectly go in-game every 16h every single time, and so I devised a program that can do it for us!

Made by arielus05 in Java (me), huge credits go to RyiSnow on YT and the people at Stack Overflow for the majority of the code here. 
I just modified the code to work how I wanted it to work :)

-- Overview --
What this does is that the program (jbMainProgram.java) counts down the hours and minutes that are left until the new set of contracts arrives.
When the timer ends, it opens up a link to a private server and that activates the 16h countdown timer without having you having to do it yourself!

-- Instructions --
*Before downloading the files, you need an IDE that supports Java, and I recommend using either Visual Studio Code or jGRASP to open up and use these files.*
*Also, steps 1 & 2 deal with the "WithAutoClicker" folder files only, so if you're using "WithoutAutoClicker" folder files, then you can skip those steps*

1. (Windows 10) Go on the search button on the bottom left, type "Change when the PC sleeps", and go on the first result.
2. Then, set to when it is going to go sleep automatically to both Screen & Sleep to 2, 3, or 5 minutes.
-This is so when the program ends and it activates the contracts, it goes to sleep shortly afterwards and you don't have to worry about your PC being on all day.
3. Choose which folder to use. "WithAutoClicker" is meant to be used while you're AFK, while "WithoutAutoClicker" is meant to be used when you are want to use the PC at the same time.
4. Download the two .java files in the chosen folder.
5. Open the two .java files in an IDE.
6. Go on jbMainProgram.java and Jailbreak at the same time to look at how much time you have until the next set of contracts come in.
7. Run jbMainProgram.java by doing Crtl+R and follow what the comments/compile messages tell you to do.
8. You're done! A window should've popped up with the 24-Hour Time of when the new set of contracts are going to appear and a countdown timer with your inputted hours and minutes.

-- In The Future -- 
I might make stylistic changes with the window popping up, or maybe make this work as an application instead...we'll see.
-- Conclusion --
I really hope this program will be helpful for tryhards like me! Maybe I will make more coding projects in the future. :)
